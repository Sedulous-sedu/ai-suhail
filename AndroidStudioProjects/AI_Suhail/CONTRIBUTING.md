- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Environment details** (OS, Flutter version, device)
- **Screenshots/logs** if applicable

### Feature Requests

For feature requests, provide:

- **Clear description** of the proposed feature
- **Use case** and motivation
- **Proposed implementation** (if you have ideas)
- **Alternative solutions** considered

### Issue Labels

We use the following labels:

- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Improvements or additions to docs
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
- `priority: high` - High priority issues

## üíª Code Style

### Dart/Flutter Guidelines

Follow the official [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style):

```dart
// Good
class UserService {
  Future<User> getUserById(int id) async {
    // Implementation
  }
}

// Use meaningful names
final userEmail = 'user@example.com';

// Prefer const constructors
const SizedBox(height: 16)
```

### Code Formatting

- Use `dart format` to format your code
- Line length: 80 characters (configurable in IDE)
- Use trailing commas for better diffs
- Organize imports alphabetically

### Documentation

- Add dartdoc comments for public APIs
- Include examples for complex functions
- Keep comments concise and relevant

```dart
/// Authenticates a user with email and password.
/// 
/// Returns [User] object if authentication succeeds,
/// throws [AuthenticationException] if credentials are invalid.
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final user = await authService.authenticate('user@example.com', 'password');
/// ```
Future<User> authenticate(String email, String password) async {
  // Implementation
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Requirements

- **Unit tests** for business logic
- **Widget tests** for UI components
- **Integration tests** for critical user flows

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/services/auth_service_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### Test Structure

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:ai_suhail/services/auth_service.dart';

void main() {
  group('AuthService', () {
    late AuthService authService;

    setUp(() {
      authService = AuthService();
    });

    test('should authenticate user with valid credentials', () async {
      // Arrange
      const email = 'test@example.com';
      const password = 'password123';

      // Act
      final result = await authService.authenticate(email, password);

      // Assert
      expect(result, isNotNull);
      expect(result.email, equals(email));
    });
  });
}
```
